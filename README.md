Horizon Budget
This is a simple JavaScript budget application and my first attempt at making a web app. I did not use any frame works for this project to help me understand new ES6 features and webpack, as well as use and understand vanilla JavaScript.

Built With
babel - Es6 transpiler
webpack - module bundler 
uniqid - Used to generate unique ID's
sass - better css
