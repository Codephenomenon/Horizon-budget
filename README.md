# Horizon Budget
This is a simple JavaScript budget application and my first project creating a web application. I did not use any frameworks for this project to help me understand new ES6 features, as well as use and understand vanilla JavaScript.

## Built With
babel - Es6 transpiler
webpack - module bundler
uniqid - Used to generate unique ID's
sass - better css
